These are the slides I used in my presentation to the Wellington FP Users group.
After each slide I showed the code for the slide and discussed how it works.

The talk covered the parts of Yesod that were of particular interest to me.

This example uses GHC 7 syntax.  GHC 6 users should replace
  [parseRoutes| with [$parseRoutes|
  [hamlet|      with [$hamlet|
  [cassius|     with [$cassius|
  [julius|      with [$julius|

To install this run this in development mode (so that you can mess with
the code while it runs)
  cabal install
  cd src
  ../dist/build/yesod-slides-devel/yesod-slides-devel

Point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000
Click to advance from one slid to the next.
Change the code and click refresh in the browser to see what happened.

When I gave the presentation I also had the package open in Leksah in GHCi
mode, but you can use any editor.
